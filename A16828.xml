            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And our pen (God willing) ſhalbe ſo tempered herein, that it ſhal diſpleaſe no reaſonable reader, nor ſurelie ſkarce them (if it may be) againſt whom in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpable defence we are forced to write.</p>
            <p>We haue in this caſe examples inough of Chriſtian modeſtie in the ancient apologies of holie Fathers in Chriſt his Church; as of S. <hi>Iuſtin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Examples of vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.</note> 
               <hi>Tertulian, Athanaſius, Hylarius</hi> and other, writing to their Princes, that perſecuted ether by errour or infidelitie, the faithful people. Whos ſtile and ſteppes ſo long as we folowe, we ſhalbe blameles in the ſight of al wiſe and good men; and offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d none, to whom the plaine truth it ſelf is not odious. As on the other ſide, we haue in our aduerſaries late bookes, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt railing,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants stile.</note> contemptuous phraſe, ſlaunderous ſpeach, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous wordes, falſe, reprochful, ſeditious matter, and al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt ſcurrilitie, what to abhorre and deteſt, and what to auoide in thes our writings; which we would haue moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like theirs, and not onelie allowable to our frendes, but (if it were poſſible, and ſo pleaſed our merciful Lord to giue vs grace in their ſight) not ingrateful to our perſecutours: whos ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as Chriſt knoweth) we ſeeke in al thes our endeuours, together with the maintenance of truth, more then our owne defence and purgation.</p>
            <p>Wherupon otherwiſe, for our owne onelie honour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, we would not ſo formallie ſtand, againſt ſo honorable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries in this world; if we thought ether their hartes (which are in Gods handes) were not vpon euident reaſon and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of our innocencie, inclinable to mercie and better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their owne ſtate and ours: or that their accuſation of vs afflicted Catholiques, were not ioined to the general repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the whole Church and the principal paſtours therof; whom by the lawe of our Chriſtian religion we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect more then our owne liues; and in cauſes of our ſoule and conſcience, to obey aboue anie earthlie Prince, by what other obligation ſo euer we be bound vnto him.</p>
            <p>And as we would gladlie paſſe in this our anſwere, with ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:200:3"/> equabilitie and indifferencie, that in defence of the ſpiritual power (which by our aduerſaries importunitie, we are driuen in maner againſt our wils to treat of) we might not iuſtlie offend the temporal, acknowledging in diuers reſpects al hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dutie to them both: ſo writing nothing that anie man ſhalbe able to proue vntrue ether in fact or faith; we truſt in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders equitie, be he Catholique or Proteſtant, that in ſo fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and neceſſarie a defence of our ſelues, and of our Superiours, as alſo of the common cauſe of our Chriſtian faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he wil not iudge our writing ſeditious, ſlaunderous or infamous libelling (as the nameles author of this inuectiue, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom we treat, vnchriſtianlie and vncourteouſlie calleth other our brethrens bookes) recording onelie the heauie perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, torments and deathes of Catholiques, in ſuch ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, plaine and ſincere ſort, as indeed al thinges were done:<note place="margin">The bookes of Engliſh perſecution moſt true.</note> and ſo as no man liuing can trulie ether charge the reporters of fiction or falſhood, or of anie euil intention of diffaming to ſtrangers their ſuperiours dealings, in making relation of our deare Countries moſt doleful calamities. For the thinges there done dailie in publique, cannot otherwiſe be hidden from the world: and ſeing they are paſſed by lawe and order of pretended iuſtice, ther can be no cauſe why them ſelues ſhould miſlike the diuulging therof; except they acknowledge in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſome iniquitie, and diſhonorable defect in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges, againſt the moſt innocent perſons whom daily they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and make away.</p>
            <p>We are not ſo peruerſlie affected (God be praiſed) as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſelie to diſhonour our Prince and Countrie,<note place="margin">The true cauſes of publiſhing our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> for whos loue in Chriſt, ſo manie haue ſo meeklie loſt their liues: or to reueale their turpitude, which we would rather couer (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) from the eyes of the world with our owne blood: but we ſet forth the truth of al thes actions, for the honour of our nation, which otherwiſe to her infinite ſhame and reproche, would be thought wholie and generallie to haue reuolted from the Catholique faith, and conſented to al the abſurdities and iniquities of this new regiment and religion, if none with zeale and extreme indeuour reſiſted ſuch pernitious innouations. Wher now as wel our owne people, as al ſtrangers in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, perceauing the diſorder to proceed but of the partialitie of a few powerable perſons abuſing her Maieſties clemencie and credulitie; doe glorifie our Lord God, that in ſo great a tentation, al the Cleargie in maner, and ſo manie of the laitie of al ſortes conſtantlie perſiſt in their fathers faith, to the loſſe of goods, landes, liues, honours, and what ſoeuer beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: and that the whole ſtate (excepting the authoritie of the
<pb facs="tcp:200:4"/> Prince) may yet be rather counted Catholique, then heretical: this is the honour of our nation in al places, which otherwiſe (for dooble reuolt and recidiuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into Schiſme, and for extreme perſecution) would be compted remediles, hopeles, and of al other places moſt infamous.</p>
            <p>Secondlie; we ſet forth thes thinges for the memorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſuch notable Martirs, as haue teſtified the truth of the Catholique faith by their pretious death.<note place="margin">See S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</note> Which was an ancient <hi>Canon</hi> and cuſtome of the primitiue Church, which appointed certaine ſpecial perſons or ſkil and learning, to note the daies of euerie ones glorious confeſſion and combat, that their memories might afterward be ſolemlie celebrated for euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie; we doe it to communicate our calamities with our brethren in faith, and the Churches of other prouinces ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding free from this miſerie, both for their warning, and our comfort, and to excite in them Chriſtian compaſſion towardes vs; that therbie and by their councel and praiers, we may find mercie and releef at Gods hand: by the example of the Oriental Churches afflicted by the <hi>Arrians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile. Epiſt. 69. &amp; 70.</note> which as we may read in <hi>S. Baſile,</hi> in their like diſtreſſes, made their general complaints by often letters and meſſingers, to the weſt Churches, ſtanding more entire and void of that Hereſie and perſecution.</p>
            <p>Finallie; we are forced to publiſh thes thinges ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie and diligentlie, to defend the doings of the ſaid holie Confeſſors and their felowes in faith, againſt the manifold ſlaunders and calumniations of certaine Heretiques or Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, vniuſtlie charging them with treaſon, and other great treſpaſſes againſt the Common-wealth, to auert the eyes of the ſimple from the true cauſes of their ſuffering; and to diſapoint the holie perſonages (if they could) of the honour done to Martirs in Gods Church. For, that is one ſpecial cauſe among manie, why they had rather make them away for forged treaſon, or other feigned offences, then for profeſſion of the truth; which in their hart they hate more then anie crime in the world. <hi>S.

            <p>Wherupon in her next viſitation of the cleargie, a ſpecial iniunction was printed and publiſhed by her commaundement, declaring that in truth ſhe had no ſuch intent,<note place="margin">Marke this circle in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the title.</note> and that no ſuche thing was implied in her title or claime of ſpiritual regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor no other thing, nor more then was before graunted to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the tearme of Supreame head: requiring al her louing ſubiectes to receiue th'othe at leaſt in that ſenſe, and ſo it ſhould ſuffice her highneſſe. By which it is now cleare, by ther owne authentical declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we ſpeake no vntrewth (as this libeller ſayth) nor abuſe not the world when we ſay ſhe is called and taken for the Supreame head of the Church of England: albeit (the thing it ſelf being far more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde and of more pernicious ſequele, then the makers of the law, which were mere layme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and moſt of them vnlearned, could then perceiue) their folowers now, would diſauow the ſame. For this article therfore as the famous biſhoppe of Rocheſter, Sir Thomas More, and a great number more in king Henrie the 8. his dayes: ſo did thos twoo laſt named martyrs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others before them moſt gladlie and conſtantlie

            <p>And to end this point, we laſtlie referre the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie to the late Martyrdome of Cartar a poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent artiſan: who was made away onelie for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a catholique booke <hi>De ſchiſmate:</hi> in which no worde was found againſt the ſtate, the quarel onelie moſt vniuſtlie being made, vpon a certaine clauſe, which by no likelie honeſt conſtruction could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine to the Q. perſon: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould once haue the vpper hand of hereſie, and <hi>Iudith</hi> cutt of the head of <hi>Holophernes:</hi> which they in their extreame ielouſie and feare of all thinges wold needes wreaſt againſt her Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>And the place ſerueth here to ſaye ſome-what of the cauſe alſo of their racking of Catholiques, which they wold haue ſtrangers beleeue neuer to be done for anie point of religion.<note place="margin">Fol. 20.</note> As for example, (ſay they, in the addition to th'end of the libel) none is aſked by torture, <hi>vvhat he beleeueth of the Maſſe or Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſuche like.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Queſtions aſked of catholiques vppon tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> As though (forſooth) ther were no queſtion perteining to faithe and religion, but tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our inward beleefe.

            <p>Yet thes were the Interrogatories for which the famous confeſſor M. Briant<note place="margin">M.

The like demaundes were put to the bleſſed martyrs Campion, Sherwin, and others vpon the torture,<note place="margin">M. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvine.</note> and of this later namelie was aſked where F. Perſons and Campion were, and whether he had ſaid Maſſe in M. Roſcarockes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and what money he had giuen him. M. Thomſon<note place="margin">M.

The ſaid yong man Cartar,<note place="margin">Cartar.</note> of whos martyrdome we laſt treated, was examined vpon the racke, vpon what Gentlemen or catholique Ladies he had beſtowed or intended to beſtowe certaine bookes of prayers and ſpiritual exerciſes and meditations which he had in his cuſtodie.

            </p>
            <p>But the wordes of M. Thomas Cotam,<note place="margin">M.

Thus therfore he ſpake and auouched openlie in the preſence of the racke maſters. <q>In-deed (quoth he) yow ar ſearchers of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crettes: for yow wolde needes knowe of me what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce I was enioined by my ghoſtlie father for my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200:11"/> ſinnes committed: and I acknowledge my frailtie that to auoide the intollerable torment of the racke I confeſſed (God forgiue me) what they demaunded therin: but when they further vrged me to vtter alſo what my ſinnes were for which that penaunce was enioined me, (a lotheſome and vnchriſtian queſtion) I then anſwered that I wolde not diſcloſe my offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſauing to God and to my ghoſtlie father alone. Wherupon they ſore tormented me and ſtil preſſed me with the ſame demaund: and I perſiſted that it was a moſt barbarous inhumane queſtion, and that I wolde not anſwere though they tormented me to death. Thus ſpake M. Cotam at his arreignme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the enimies being aſhamed, the Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Tower ther preſent bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to denie the whole: wheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to M. Cota<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> replied againe thus: And is not this trew? Here is preſent D.

            </p>
            <p>As for the moderation, great pitie, and courtiſie, which by your Libel you wold haue the world beleue her Maieſties miniſters haue euer vſed,<note place="margin">The cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques.</note> in giuing the torment to the perſons aforeſaid and other Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques: the poore innocentes haue felt it, and our Lord God knoweth the contrarie. And we can put you in remembrance, that you did it with extreame rigour and diſpite commonlie vpon no dew preſumption nor reaſonable ſuſpition of diſcouerie of anie impor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tant matter therby. Looke in your recordes what ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of treaſons or great matters you could haue in yong Sherwood, who was the firſt in our memorie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:200:11"/> that was put to the rack for matters of conſcience, then when no man dreamed of anie thes feined new conſpiracies?</p>
            <p>See whether a portable Altare be a ſufficient cauſe to giue the torture to a graue worſhipful perſon not ſo much as ſuſpected of treaſon or anie diſobedience, other then in caſes of conſcience? Whether bookes of prayers and meditations ſpiritual, or the printing and ſpreading of them be a racke-matter in anie common wealth Chriſtian? Looke whether your ordinarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes were of that weight and qualitie, as were to be anſwered by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint of the racke? Let the world ſee what one confeſſion of treaſonable matter you haue wreſted out by the ſo often tormenting of ſo many, and what great ſecreſies touching the ſtate (which you pretend ſo earneſtlie to ſeeke for) you haue found amongſt them al? No, no, nothing was ther in thos religious hartes but innocencie and true religion: it is that which you puniſhed, torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, and deadlie hated in them. Yf they wold haue in the leaſt pointe in the world condeſcended to your deſires in that, or but once for your pleaſures preſented them ſelues at your Schiſmatical prayers, al racking &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had bene cleared and paſt.</p>
            <p>Wherbie al the world ſeeth, you did al for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not as for anie conſcience that way (wherwith moſt of you ar not much troubled) but becauſe the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate of a number dependeth on this new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Remember whether you layd not M. Thomſon on the racke, againſt al good vſe and order, before you euer examined him? what preſumptions had you ſo pregnant that you muſt racke the famous man father Campion about the Iriſhe commotion, or collection of monie for the maintenance of the ſame? or of anie knowledge he had of killing the <hi>Greateſt,</hi> as you miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpeake in your booke?<note place="margin">Fol. 2.</note> Haue you not ordinarilie

For what other cauſe did you threaten the torture to M. Osburne, but to make him confeſſe that he had ſaid Maſſe before the true noble confeſſors of Chriſt, my L. Vaux and Sir Thomas Treſſame?

            <p>Euerie reaſon ſhould conclude that the Prieſtes were executed vpon no charge of new religious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but vpon old ſtatutes onely for matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, in which ſenſe no one of them in truth doth conclude.</p>
            <p>And the firſt Reaſon<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> cometh onely to this end; that her Maieſtie contemning the Popes Bulles for a good while, at length ſpying them to be dangerous, reuiued former lawes for prohibition of them within her dominions. Which Argument being laid for the ground of al, hath nether the concluſion looked for againſt thos Prieſtes in particuler, nor truth of narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the premiſſes. For nether were ther anie ſuch Bulles and excommunications which (they ſay) were tollerated or contemned for certaine years; none at al (I ſay) of that kind publiſhed in her dayes before that one of Pius quintus mentioned in the next argument folowing: nether were ther extant anie old ſtatutes (that we know) to be reuiued, againſt ſuch exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in any ſuch ſenſe as they wil ſeeme to make them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument prooueth onelie that Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton for publiſhing Pius quintus his Bul,<note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon.</note> was by their lawes condemned and put to death, and was the firſt that was executed for matters comming from Rome:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:200:17"/> wherupon how ſubſtantiallie it is inferred, that father Campian and his fellowes were not condemned for Religion, but for tranſgreſſion of old ſtatutes of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, let the wiſe conſider: and withal, let the learned in our lawes determine whether the bringing in of a Bul of excommunication from Rome were treaſon in the dayes and by the ſtatute of K.

            <p>Secondly we complaine iuſtly of perſecution; for that our cauſe for which we ſuffer, is the faith of al our Forefathers; the faith of our perſecutors owne aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; the faith into which our countrie was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and by which we ar called Chriſtian; the faith of the Catholique Churches &amp; Kingdoms round about vs; the faith that we promiſed in our regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and therfore can not be forced from it, nor puniſhed for it, by any lawe of God, Nature, or Nations.</p>

And further he addeth (which is a notorious vntruth) that the ſaid Prelate voluntarilie left both his Chauncelorſhip and Archbiſhopricke: wher al wiſe men wil witnes with him and for him, that he was moſt vniuſtlie with the reſt of his Suffraganes and brethren Biſhops for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to take that abſurd othe of the Q.

            <p>The cauſe why they durſt not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by anie humane feare or authoritie to inueſt her, was;<note place="margin">VVhy the Catholique Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to croune this Q.</note> for that they had euident probabilities and arguments to doubt, that ſhe ment ether not to take the othe or not to keepe the ſame, which al Chriſtian kinges (and ſpeciallie ours in England) doe make in their Coronation for maintenance of holy Churches lawes, honors, peace and priuileges, and other duties due to euery ſtate, as in the time and graunt of K. Edward the Confeſſor.</p>
            <p>They doubted alſo leſt ſhe would refuſe in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie time of her ſacre, the ſolemne diuine ceremonie of vnction (accuſtomed in the conſecration of al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian princes) through the euil aduiſes of certaine yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g counſellers, being then in the heate prime and pride of their Hereſie, wherby great ſcandal might ariſe, and hurt to the Realme.

            <p>Otherwiſe doubtles al the Biſhops, and the reſt of the principal of the inferior Cleargie did ſtoutlie and worthelie as could be wiſhed, &amp; as was poſſible in that ſodaine aſſault of Hereſie; fearing at the ſame time their perſonal peril ſo litle,<note place="margin">The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergie to Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Q.</note> that they were manie of them of that mind that it ſhould be good to vſe the cenſure of Excommunication againſt her Highenes and ſome of her leaders into that reuolt ſo dangerous and ſhameful to the ſtate, ſo latelie reconciled to the ſea Apoſtolique, and by othe and promis of al eſtates confirmed.</p>
            <p>But the wiſer of the Biſhops, or at leaſt the mylder ſort, perſuaded the contrarie for manie inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that might enſue: and ſo they rather reſolued the matter to be remitted to the high Paſtor of Chriſtes vniuerſal Church, then to be executed by them that were her ſubiects, not without peril perhaps of ſome further tumult ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dal and trouble to the whole Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; whom they would haue interpreted to haue done it of malicious and rebellions mind, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of loue and dutie, of which al ſuch cenſures indeed doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, how ſo-euer the partie affected and ſicke in ſoule (eſpeciallie Princes except they be verie wel trained in the feare of God) accept the ſame; wel remembring that manie Kinges had killed their Paſtors in like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

But for their holding of any ſuch aſſertion, I muſt and doe ſay that it is ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, and moſt vntrue. For ther is a great difference to ſay ſhe is not to rule the Biſhops in cauſes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, or in matter of miniſtring the Sacraments, preaching, and doctrine; and to ſay, ſhe is not Q. or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour ouer the Cleargie, or that Prieſtes or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſons be not her ſubiects. For they are alſo bound, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> monkes and religious, as <hi>S.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:200:33"/> to doe them al honour and ſeruice in that behalf; as the Libeller right wel knoweth that al Catholike Biſhops and Prelates of the Church, euer haue done, and doe at this day both in our Realme and in al other Realmes abrode to their lawful Kinges, yea to heathen kinges alſo; though in matters of religion and of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual charge, neither Heathen nor Chriſtian kinges be their ſuperiours, or ought to direct them, but rather to take direction from them.</p>
            <p>Thus then ouer and aboue al former recompted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, by opprobrious tongues, lying lippes and pennes, we be perſecuted for defence of our Fathers faith &amp; the Churches truth.

            <p>By al which we may ſee the notable diſcret and ſincere dealing of Catholiques al this while about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene years that this ſentence hath bene extant and publiſhed; and their manifold endeuours to mitigate and eaſe the burthen therof, in al ſuch as might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie haue remorſe to obey and acknowledge the Q.

            <p>Some ſuch demaundes the Scribes and Phareſies and other of the Iewes ſectaries,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Ievves vvith Chriſt.</note> propoſed in times paſt to our Sauiour, to intrap him i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeech, &amp; to driue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vtter ſome treaſonable wordes or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the Emperours regalitie ouer the people of God; which they preſumed to be euil thought of of diuers, and ſpeciallie of the better and more exact zelators of the lawe, notwithſtanding that ether for feare or other cauſes euerie one ſemed in al exterior offices to obey. Of which tempting queſtions, though Chriſt by his diuine wiſdome eaſilie diſcharged him ſelf; neuertheleſſe they ceaſed not ſtil to exclame; <hi>Hunc inuenimus prohibentem tributa dare Caeſari;</hi> as others did afterward the like of S.

            <p>When al other pretences, practizes, forged cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and falſe witneſſes againſt Prieſts or Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques doe faile; then are thes made iuſt quarels of their death, and the higheſt treaſons in the world: <hi>viz</hi> to affirme vpon their vnreaſonable and importune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, that if (which God forbid) the Q. by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, ſhould fal to Arrianiſme, Apoſtacie or Atheiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me (whervnto mans frailtie is ſubiect) ſhe might be depriued and her ſubiects diſcharged of obedience to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:200:41"/> her: this is the onelie treaſon which they haue tried out of Catholiques. Which for al that in truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be treaſon, how plainlie or voluntarily ſo euer it were ſpoken; much leſſe being wreſted out by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and ſubtile drift of interrogatories.</p>
            <p>The Libeller ſaieth nothing is puniſhed in vs for queſtion of Conſcience or Religion:<note place="margin">The queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Popes Supremacie a matter of Diuinitie and not of State.</note> but yet this is ſuch in the ſight of al reſonable men in the world. For it is a mere matter of Diuinitie, if not defined for vs, yet at leaſt diſputable in ſchoole as them ſelues wil confeſſe. It concerneth the Popes ſupremacie and power Apoſtolical; for which this Libeller affirmeth and repeateth often that none be endangered of life or limme in England. This propoſition (I ſay) or anie other equiualent to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pope hath power to excommunicate or depriue a Prince in caſe of Hereſie or Apoſtacie; and conſequentlie, to abſolue his ſubiects from their othe and obedience to him; or to ſtand in defence of them ſelues and the Catholique faith againſt him; cannot be proued treaſon by the ſtatute of Edward the third, vpon which onelie he ſayeth we be condemned for traitours. Who ſo euer ſhould auouch the ſame, in anie Chriſtian countrie in the world; or in our owne countrie, in the time of the ſaid K. Edward had held the ſame opinion; ſhould not, nor could not haue bene conuicted of treaſon, treaſonable aſſertion, or euil affection to the Prince or countrie; becauſe it ſtandeth with the honor and ſafetie of the whole common wealth, and the rulers therof, ſo far to be ſubiect and obedient to Chriſt and his Church, that they count them ſelues no longer to ſtand or reigne rightfullie, then they ſtand and reigne for the aduauncement of Gods truth and kingdome in earth, which is his Church.</p>
            <p>What treaſon had it bene to Q. Marie (whos regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of their greefe &amp; our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:200:41"/> this Libeller ſo often alleageth) if in ſcoole, booke or pulpit, it had bene affirmed, that for Hereſie or Atheiſme, a Prince, or her ſelf might be depoſed?</p>

The like might be ſaid of th'other great Monarch of Spaine; who would not haue his owne iſſue (which God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bleſſe) ſuccede him, if it were not Catholique. No more would th'Emperours ſacred Maieſty; no nor the Popes Holines (in ſpiritual affaires and regiment of our ſoules, ſuperior to al the reſt) count anie of his owne ſubiects traitors; for houlding, that in caſe of Hereſie or Apoſtacie, he might be depoſed or looſe the right of his place and dignitie.</p>
            <p>We aſke here the Libeller; by what law or cuſtome, Canon, Ciuil or National of our countrie or other, is this made treaſon? Or why it ſhould be more trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in England then in anie other place? ſeing no lawe hitherto hath paſſed by authoritie againſt the ſame; nor anie opinion, to be compted preiudicial to anie Prince or ſtate; no aſſertion treaſonable that is true in diuinitie: for that no truth agreable to Gods lawe and mans, can be contrarie to the lauful ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of anie power or potentate in earth.</p>
            <p>But you wil ſay (and that is al you can ſay) that though the general propoſition,<note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vvith the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver.</note> that Princes for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie may be depoſed, were true; yet th'application therof to her Maieſtie in particuler, may be treaſon; for that it is made high treaſon by act of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the thirtenth yeare of the Q. reigne for anie to cal her an Heretique or a Shiſmatique vnder paine of death.</p>
            <p>To which we anſwere; firſt, that our affirming that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:200:42"/> ſhe may be depoſed for Hereſie, doth not at al auouch her to be one; no more then the like aſſertion of the K. of Spaine would implie him to be ſuch an one, or vs to thinke him ſuch an one: and therfore if your owne conſcience accuſe your ſelues, or giue you ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition that what ſoeuer is ſaid toucheth you; it is you that applie the general ſpeach to your owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and not we. Secondlie we ſay, that your ſaid law may bind vs that be ſubiects not to ſpeake ſo vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie of her, to whom God hath giuen power ouer vs in this lyfe, as to cal her Heretique, Infidel, or Schiſmatique (for thos be the termes of your ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te) though we ſhould know her damnably to erre in Religion: but the Pope is not ſubiect to that lawe, but he may according to th'authoritie giuen vnto him, determine by the lawes of God &amp; holie Church, who is an Heretique; and ſo wil the learned of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine ſchooles whether you wil or no, applie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Hereſie or of an Heretique, to what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>As for vs &amp; our brethren executed, you know none euer called the Q.

A volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie reuolt (ſaid
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:200:42"/> he) from the Romane and Catholique Church. Wel then ſaid the Magiſtrate; goe toe; what thinkeſt thou of the Q. is ſhe a Schiſmatique or no? (for of anie thing ſaid before they had no iuſt pretence of law to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne him of treaſon): the man of God anſwered, that he neuer ſo called her for reuerence of her highe dignitie; nor could tel (for that he knew not her Maieſties meaning) whether this Religion were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by her ſpecial commandement and authoritie or no; and therfore humblie prayed them, not to vrge him wittinglie to commit anie crime, wherin hitherto he had neuer offended. But they would not ſo ceaſe; but ſaid they could wel reſolue him in that, that in deed this Engliſh religion was eſtabliſhed by her, and by her mainteined: the Confeſſor refuſed ſtil to anſwere; ſaying that he knew not ſo much, for al that, of her mind &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, but it might proceed rather of ſome of her miniſters more then of her ſelf: in which ſort (as S.

The Confeſſor being loth to exaſperate the Prince on the one ſide, and more loth to offend God or giue ſcandal on tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; after he had pauſed a while, and aſked ſtrength from aboue, finallie he ſaid; if ſhe be the ſetter forth and defender of this Religion, then ſhe is a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique &amp; Heretique in deed. And ſo they got the holie perſon into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of their lawe, for which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was Martired.</p>
            <p>Now we doe appeale to the equitie of al Chriſtian people how loth our brethren be to offend by word or deed the honour of the Q.;<note place="margin">The offence of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> &amp; after what a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

            <p>Laſtlie we ſay; that how ſoeuer anie one Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que or other hath bene driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſhalbe forced hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to offend againſt the ſaid Statute of Supremacy or Hereſy, or againſt any new law made in that behalf; yet in equity they can not be purſued to death for that cauſe; ſeing our aduerſary proteſteth here publiquely in his Libel, that no other treſpaſſes ſhalbe obiected to vs as matter capital, ſaui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſo made by th'ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de lawes of the Realme.

            <p>It is not the good fortune of a few yeares felicitie, that moueth the graue and ſage gouernours of the world (though the Libeller, to make fooles faine,<note place="margin">The vviſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Catholique Princes.</note> vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth their good lucke in England much, ſince their breach with Gods Church): but they wil looke far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about them, and ſee the euents of thes ſtrange at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in vs, and the iudgements of God for the ſame: not onelie til th'end of K.

Ouer which, as vpon the Prince and ſtate preſent of our Countrie, we humblie on our knees with continual teares, deſire God to haue mercie; and to auert his indignation from them and vs: that the

            <p>But now for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt that this good man would driue into mens heades, that no ſtate ſhould be in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie, if the Pope might depriue the Prince at his pleaſure; it is a bugge fit onelie to feare babes.

            <p>This is not to depoſe Kinges at his pleaſure; nor is cauſe ſufficient why anie iuſt and Chriſtian Prince
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:200:64"/> ſhould ſtand in doubt of the Popes cenſures: onelie ſuch as be Heretiques, or intend to ſhake of the yoke of Chriſt and their faith in him,<note place="margin">VVhat Princes only feare the Pope.</note> haue cauſe in their conſcience to doubt both the Churches diſcipline, &amp; the plagues of God: which wil not faile them, how ſo euer by humane force and violence they protect them ſelues for a time, from his Miniſters ſentence &amp; ſweet corrections.</p>
            <p>Al iuſt and Catholique Kinges are ſo far from doubting or miſliking Gods ordinance and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize of the ſea Apoſtolique herein; that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it moſt neceſſarie for the ſtabilitie of their kingdomes, and the continuaunce of their poſteritie in the glorie therof, that for their regiment in faith and life they ſtand in ſome reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d awe of their cheefe Paſtors; which is a neceſſarie and honorable bridle of Princes in their youth, and al the dayes of their life, to ſtay them from dangerous diſorders, and ſo to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them in ther gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they may raigne lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and happilie ouer their people: wher otherwiſe they might fal into infinite calamities; and be ether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, depoſed, or ſhamefullie deſtroyed by their owne ſubiects; whether they be depriued by holie Churches cenſure, or no.</p>
            <p>Nether doth anie godlie Chriſtian Prince at this day (as we thinke) wiſhe their Empire, ether in them ſelues, their children, or poſteritie to dure anie longer; then they continue in the Catholique faith, and the communion of the Sea and Church Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: nor would ſuffer anie of their name or blood to reigne after them, that were like to be Heretiques; but rather would diſinherite or execute them with their owne handes, then feare or expect their depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Pope.</p>
            <p>Therfore though with ſuch as feele their owne fault it ſoundeth euil to heare of the Authoritie and vſage
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:200:65"/> of Gods Church in cenſuring kinges: yet it troubleth not anie iuſt and lauful Prince: eſpeciallie when by their wiſdome &amp; experience they may perceiue, that Princes, aboue al other, both good and euil, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to humane caſualties; and may fal, and looſe their kingdomes by an hundreth accidents of mutinies and rebellions of their ſubiects, or by external or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtical warres of Competitours or enimyes: to al which,<note place="margin">The great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities vvhich grovv to al kingdomes by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> the Popes highe authoritie and intereſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth great ſtay and moderation, in deciding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies of titles, and cauſes of ciuil or forraine warres; and by his manifould endeuours of Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and compoſition, wherof al the kinges and ſtates Chriſtian, haue at ſondrie times of their diſtreſſes, receiued ſingular profit; as appeareth in the hiſtories of the warres, betwixt our nation, Fraunce, and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and in our owne Ciuil tumultes, which haue bene often appeaſed by the mediation of the Pope: both parties deferring to him as to the high Prieſt and general Arbiter of Chriſtian Princes and people (being to al indifferent without al partialitie) the deciſion of thos thinges which otherwiſe could not by lawes nor by armes without-lamentable deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and much blood be determined. Wherebie Princes of leſſe power, iniuried by the greater and mightier, haue euer found ſuccour and redreſſe: and iuſt kinges diſtreſſed by their rebellious ſubiectes, haue had ſingular aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>As we may ſee in the ſtories both of our owne Countrie, wher the Popes haue ſent diuers Legates to the Barons, being vp againſt their lauful Souerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes, to admoniſh them to lay doune their armes; and when they would not, excommunicated them; by which meanes manie a king with vs hath kept his Croune, which otherwiſe had bene depriued, by tumultuous and popular ſedition: and no leſſe in th'e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xamples

            <p>Let the graue and wiſe men of al nations conſider with vs, whether Princes be in more danger of their ſtate by the lauful Paſtors of their ſoules that iudge by Gods ſpirit, by counſel, deliberation, order and authoritie; without malice, hatred, or partialitie: or by Heretiques, ſeditious and rebellious perſons; that deale by erroneous conſcience, phantaſie and furie.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtantes plainlie hould in al their writings and ſchooles, and ſo practize in the ſight of al the world; that Princes may for tirannie or Religion be reſiſted &amp; depriued. We and al Catholiques likewiſe affirme that for Hereſie and ſome other great enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, they may be excommunicated and further cenſured. But the Proteſtants would haue them ſelues &amp; the ſubiects to rebel and throwe doune their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, on their owne head and wilfulnes; and them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:200:66"/> ſelues to be iudges of their Soueraignes deſertes and Religion. Now we demaund of the Libeller, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Princes ſo frendlie warning of their dangerous eſtates;<note place="margin">A reſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller.</note> if Popes may vſe ſuch authoritie ouer Princes, whether the Kinges of Chriſtendome (whom their owne ſect-maiſters confeſſe may be depoſed) ſtand not in far greater hazard of their dominions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by the brutiſh and ſeditious people, armed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with furie, and often alſo (as at this preſent) with Hereſie, then they are of Popes?</p>
            <p>It was not the Pope that gaue lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſubiects of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to take armes againſt their natural liege and Q.; to empriſon her; and to cauſe her by feare of death to reſigne her Croune. It is not the Pope that embouldened them barbarouſlie, to reſtraine their noble yong King, and ſo often to rebel againſt him: though nether they for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion haue anie reaſon to depriue him; nor the Popes Holines (otherwiſe then for the iuſtice of his quarel againſt his rebels) anie cauſe to defend him. It was not the Pope that licenſed the ſubiects of the king Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, to fight ſo long and obſtinatlie againſt their Lord and maiſter: nor that encouraged them to depriue him of his ſoueraigntie and ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. It was not the Pope that hath hazarded three mightie Kinges, his moſt Chriſtian Maieſty that now is, and his two crouned brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before him, of their States; and bereaued them of manie great partes and cities of their kingdome: or that went about to depriue them, euen in the time of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie and yong years. Popes vſe to defend inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, not to deſtroye them in their nonage; or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their minoritie. And ſuch is otherwiſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifould hazard of kinges by rebellions, that in our owne Countrie,<note place="margin">The danger of Princes by rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the Child hath depoſed his Father; the Vncle his Nephew; the Wife her owne Huſband:

And we maruel much, this Libeller that would ſeeme to be ſuch a Statesman and a Counſeller to forreine kinges, could find no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to them and their countries, ſauing of the Popes power ouer them: which in verie truth by Chriſts ſpecial prouidence, is the greateſt protection, guarde, and ſtay, that innocent Princes and their people can haue: the awe and reuerend reſpect of his holie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie keeping thouſandes from rebellion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion; and a number of iuſt Princes in their empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, which els had bene in diuers countries ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtantes cannot proue by example of al nations &amp; times ſince Chriſt, that anie one hath bene depoſed, that was not prooued to be a notorious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique or euil man.

            <p>Wherby we ſee; that though it be not alwaies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie nor commendable for Prieſtes, which ſhould be the authors and perſuaders of peace to al Princes and people, to be giuen to blood, warres and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (eſpeciallie by their owne handes); or without great cauſe to vſe external force and violence againſt offendors: yet the ſword may be drawen for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and is to be drawen according to their councel and direction.</p>

            <p>Feare is neuer a ſure nor long keeper of his maiſter.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:200:112"/> the victorie that they deſire.<note place="margin">Math. 10.

            <p>But to returne to our purpoſe and to the Libellers profer of mitigation or ceaſing this perſecution, vpon condition we would deale no more in ſecret, but openlie. We proteſt before God and al his Saints, that we wil (vpon anie reaſonable ſecuritie of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, libertie of conſcience, permiſſion to exerciſe Chriſtian Catholique offices, to the ſaluation of our owne ſoules and our brethren) doe the ſame thinges publiquelie which we now doe ſecretlie, in al peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prieſtlie ſort as hitherto we haue accuſtomed: and that ſo, thos things which now you ſuſpect to be done againſt the ſtate (for that they be done i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couert) may plainlie appeare vnto you nothing els indeed, but mere matter of conſcience and religion; as in veritie they are.</p>
            <p>Therfore, if ſuch as gouerne our ſtate vnder her Maieſty at this day, can not be induced to reuoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues and the whole Realme (which were abſolutelie the beſt) to the former Catholique ſtate and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition wherin their aunceſtors left it, and them ſelues found it, in reſpect perhaps of ſome litle cheke or diſhonour which they may conceiue would enſue by acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their former errour; (though in ſincere truth it muſt needes proue finallie more diſhonorable and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to perſeuer): yet at the leaſt, let their wiſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that their principal worldlie errour was; that in the beginning, or long ſince, they gaue not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of conſcience to Catholiques (being farre the greater and more reſpectiue part of the Realme) as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:200:113"/> other of their religion and profeſſion haue done, to their owne great aduantage, in <hi>Germanie</hi> and other Prouinces adioining; which errour (no doubt) might yet in great part or wholie be redreſſed, if they would but now at length haue ſome pitie of their people: the greater part wherof languiſheth away in bodie and ſoule moſt lamentablie, onlie vpon an obſtinate punto &amp; formalitie (as is thought) of ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aduerſaries, who wil not ſeeme to yeeld in any one iote or circumſtance, though neuer ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie might enſue therof.</p>
            <p>Which matter of libertie of Conſcience we moue not percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for our owne benefite ſo much, as for our aduerſaries weale, and worldlie ſecuritie, wherof they wil ſeeme to haue both miſtruſt and ſollicitude. And perhaps the wiſdome of God wil ſound otherwiſe and ſay to vs,<note place="margin">Mat. 20.22.</note> 
               <hi>Neſcitis quid petatis:</hi> iudging it to be farre more to his honour and glorie, and the breefer way to ſaluation of our whole Nation,<note place="margin">The vvay of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more ſure for vs.</note> and of moe ſoules in particular, that we ſhould paſſe through this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and winne our owne and our brethrens ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by our blood. And indeed if the <hi>Germane Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> had bene ſo reſtreined, perſecuted &amp; put to death, as the Engliſh haue bene thes years; and had not gone by halfes with the Proteſtantes as in ſome places they haue done: they had had perhaps farre moe Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques at this day, and them more zealous; and their whole nation (perchance) reduced ere this: which now, for the proteſtants, ſtandeth not ſo much on their religion or conſcience in Hereſie; as vpon their mutual peace, concord, and concurrence with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques.</p>
            <p>Wel; what were beſt for vs in this caſe God onelie knoweth.<note place="margin">Ro. 6.19.</note>

            <p>If to none of thes conditions they can be brought, but wil haue our bodies, goods, life and ſoules:<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> then let our Lord God the iuſt Arbitrer of al thinges, and Iudge of Princes as wel as poore men, and the onelie comforter of the afflicted, diſcerne our cauſe.
